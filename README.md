# Lilith Planning Poker APIs

Back Planning Poker is a project that leverages TypeScript, NestJS, and GraphQL subscriptions to facilitate efficient back-end planning sessions using the popular Planning Poker technique. This project aims to streamline the estimation process for development tasks, ensuring better accuracy and collaboration among team members.

## Features

- **Real-time Collaboration**: Utilize GraphQL subscriptions to enable real-time collaboration during planning sessions, allowing team members to instantly see and discuss estimations.

- **Scalable Architecture**: Built on NestJS, a powerful and extensible Node.js framework, the project provides a scalable and modular architecture for easy maintenance and future enhancements.

- **TypeScript**: Leverage the benefits of TypeScript for static typing, enhanced code readability, and improved development productivity.

## Technologies Used

- **NestJS**: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, scalable, and maintainable server-side applications.

- **GraphQL**: A query language and runtime for APIs that enables efficient data fetching and real-time updates.

- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types to the language, improving code quality and development experience.
